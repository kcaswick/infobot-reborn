# Infobot Reborn Feature Priorities

This document outlines the prioritized implementation plan for Infobot Reborn, focusing on delivering core functionality first while preserving the distinctive character of the original Infobot.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
The foundation of the system focusing on essential knowledge management:

1. **Factoid Storage & Retrieval**
   - Database schema for factoid storage
   - Basic query system
   - Support for "is" and "are" factoids
   - Legacy factoid import

2. **Natural Language Understanding**
   - Parse various question formats ("What is X?", "X?", etc.)
   - Identify factoid creation intent ("X is Y")
   - Context-aware response selection

3. **Response Formatting**
   - Support for `<reply>` format
   - Variable substitution ($who, $date)
   - Random responses via pipe separator (A|B|C)
   - Action formatting

4. **Knowledge Base Management**
   - Import data from legacy Infobot
   - API for factoid operations
   - Basic persistence layer

### Phase 2: Interactive Features
Building on the core to create engaging interactions:

1. **Factoid Modification**
   - Adding new factoids via natural language
   - Modification with "also", "no", and regex substitution
   - Forgetting/deleting factoids
   - Permission management for modifications

2. **Conversation Style**
   - Replicate Infobot's distinct personality
   - Appropriate informality and humor
   - Context-dependent responses
   - Handling ambiguity

3. **Karma System**
   - Track reputation with `++` and `--`
   - Karma querying and reporting
   - Persistence of karma data

4. **Status Reporting**
   - Bot statistics (uptime, factoid count)
   - Usage metrics
   - Performance data

### Phase 3: Utility Integrations
Expanding functionality with useful services:

1. **Weather**
   - Modern weather API integration
   - Location detection
   - Formatted weather reports

2. **Search Interfaces**
   - IMDB lookups for movies
   - Dictionary integration
   - Web search capabilities
   - Specialized knowledge sources

3. **Translation**
   - Modern translation API integration
   - Multi-language support
   - Natural language interface for translation requests

4. **RSS/News**
   - Fetch current information from feeds
   - Topic monitoring
   - Event notification

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
Polishing and extending the system:

1. **Plugin System**
   - Framework for easy extension
   - Standard plugin API
   - Plugin discovery and management

2. **Admin Interface**
   - User management
   - Configuration control
   - Moderation tools
   - System monitoring

3. **Legacy Add-ons**
   - Nickometer
   - Excuse generator
   - Flight information
   - Currency conversion

4. **Custom RL Training**
   - Fine-tune model behavior
   - Improve factoid extraction
   - Enhance conversational abilities
   - Personality alignment with original Infobot

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Modular Development**
   - Each component should be independently testable
   - Clear interfaces between modules
   - Dependency injection for flexibility

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Get basic functionality working first
   - Add complexity incrementally
   - Regular user testing at each phase

3. **Python Best Practices**
   - Type hints throughout
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Documentation as code develops
   - Asynchronous where appropriate

4. **LLM Integration**
   - Start with prompt engineering for behavior
   - Progress to fine-tuning as needed
   - Ensure model is swappable
