# .copilotignore - Override .gitignore for AI coding assistants
# 
# This file allows AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) to access
# files that are gitignored but useful for context during development.
#
# Negation patterns (!) tell AI tools to INCLUDE these paths even though
# they're in .gitignore. Standard ignore patterns tell AI to EXCLUDE them.

# Allow AI to see temporary work and runtime data for debugging/context
!temp/
!data/

# But still hide these from AI (too noisy/large)
